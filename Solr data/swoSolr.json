ANCOVA with interaction yields saturated data modelling e.g. different means per group and gene. Covariate adjustment can help to correct for possible selection bias. Variance homogeneity and uncorrelated residuals cannot be expected. Application of ordinary least squares gives unbiased, but no longer optimal estimates (Gauss-Markov-Aitken). Therefore, using the classical F-test is inappropriate, due to correlation. The test statistic however mirrors deviations from the null hypothesis. In combination with a permutation approach, empirical significance levels can be approximated. Alternatively, an approximation yields asymptotic p-values." ,"label": "GlobalAncova" ,"comment": ""

This license is sometimes referred to as the 3-clause BSD license.

According to the GNU Project, the modified BSD license is not bad, as lax permissive licenses go, though the Apache 2.0 license is preferable. However, it is risky to recommend use of âthe BSD licenseâ?, even for special cases such as small programs, because confusion could easily occur and lead to use of the flawed original BSD license. To avoid this risk, you can suggest the X11 license instead. The X11 license and the modified BSD license are more or less equivalent.

According to the GNU project, the Apache 2.0 license is better for substantial programs, since it prevents patent treachery." ,"label": "language:en,value:obsolete_Modified BSD License" ,"comment": ""

pattern language that satisfy the required conditions. A prototypical instantiation
of this task is the task of finding frequent itemsets (sets of items, such as
bread, butter), which are often found together in a transaction (e.g., a market
basket) (Aggrawal et al 1993). The condition that a pattern (itemset) has to
satisfy in this case is to appear in (hold true for) a sufficiently high proportion
(called support and denoted by s) of the transactions in the input dataset.
With the increasing interest in mining complex data, mining frequent patterns
is also considered for structured data. We can thus talk about mining frequent
subsequences or mining frequent subgraphs in sequence or graph data. We can
consider as frequency the multiple occurrences of a pattern in a single data
structure (e.g., sequence or graph) or the single occurrences of a pattern in
multiple data structures."

T) is often assumed to be a sample taken from a population according to a
probability distribution. A probability distribution/density function assigns a
non-negative probability/density to each object of type T. Probably the most
general data mining task (Hand et al. 2001) is the task of estimating the (joint)
probability distribution D over type T from a set of data items or a sample
drawn from that distribution.
As mentioned above, in the most typical case we would have T = Tuple(T1,
. . ., Tk), where each of T1, . . ., Tk is Boolean, Discrete(S) or Real. We talk about
the joint probability distribution to emphasize the difference to the marginal
distributions of each of the variables of type T1, . . ., Tk: the joint distribution
captures the interactions among the variables.
Representing multi-variate distributions is a non-trivial task. Two approaches
are commonly used in data mining. In the density-based clustering paradigm,
mixtures of multi-variate Gaussian distributions are typically considered (Hand
et al. 2001). Probabilistic graphical models, most notably Bayesian networks,
represent graphically the (in)dependencies between the variables: Learning their
structure and parameters is an important approach to the problem of estimating
the joint probability distribution."

The methodology is illustrated with an example from the production of sausages with responses from near infrared reflectance spectroscopy. A closely related method for testing relationships in uniresponse regression with collinear explanatory variables is also presented.

A program is free software if users have all of these freedoms.

According to the GNU Project, the modified BSD license is not bad, as lax permissive licenses go, though the Apache 2.0 license is preferable.
